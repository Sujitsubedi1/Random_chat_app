  <h1>👶 Child Safety Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 22, 2025</p>

  <p>At Random Chat, protecting children is a top priority. We have strict safety guidelines in place to ensure the platform is not misused.</p>

  <h2>🚫 Not for Children Under 18</h2>
  <p>This app is strictly intended for users <strong>18 years or older</strong>. By using this app, you confirm that you meet this age requirement. If we become aware that a user is under 18, their access may be revoked.</p>

  <h2>🧠 No Discussion Involving Minors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No content involving minors</li>
    <li>No asking about or impersonating minors</li>
    <li>No inappropriate or suggestive conversations targeting underage individuals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Violators may be permanently banned and reported to appropriate authorities.</p>

  <h2>🛡️ Moderation & Reporting</h2>
  <p>We automatically flag suspicious content using keyword detection and user reports. Reported chats may be reviewed and users violating safety rules may be removed silently.</p>
